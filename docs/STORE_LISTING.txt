## Justification for Permissions

* Why does this extension need `<all_urls>` content script permission?

The extension provides customizable keyboard shortcuts that allow users to trigger custom ChatGPT prompts from any website. For these shortcuts to work consistently across all websites (job boards, documentation sites, emails, social media, etc.), the lightweight keyboard listener must be available on all pages.

The content script:
- Only listens for keyboard shortcuts
- Does not read page content or collect any data
- Only sends a message to the background script when a configured shortcut is pressed
- Is minimal (~100 lines) and can be reviewed in the open source repository

Users expect keyboard shortcuts to work everywhere, which is why we need this broad permission. The extension does not use this permission for any data collection or tracking.
