# Screenshot Guide for Chrome Web Store

Chrome Web Store requires 1-5 screenshots, each **1280×800 px** or **640×400 px**.

**Recommended:** 1280×800 for better quality on high-resolution displays.

## Directory Location

Save all screenshots to the **`screenshots/`** directory in the project root. This keeps Chrome Web Store assets separate from extension code and makes it clear these are for marketing/store listing purposes.

## Required Screenshots

### 1. Extension Options Page (REQUIRED)
**What to capture:** The main configuration page showing your custom actions

**Steps:**
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "ChatGPT Custom Prompts" and click "Extension options"
3. Make sure you have 3-4 example actions configured
4. Set your browser window to exactly 1280×800 pixels
5. Take a screenshot of the entire options page

**What should be visible:**
- Header with "ChatGPT Custom Prompts" and icon
- Global Settings section
- At least 3 configured actions showing:
  - Action titles

### 2. Context Menu in Action (REQUIRED)

5. Position your browser so the selected text AND the context menu are both visible

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts Configuration (OPTIONAL)
**What to capture:** The keyboard shortcut capture interface

**Steps:**

2. Trigger one of your actions (via context menu or shortcut)
3. ChatGPT tab opens with your text and prompt already in the input field
4. Take screenshot BEFORE clicking send (so the prompt is visible)

**What should be visible:**
- ChatGPT interface
- Your custom prompt + selected text in the input field
