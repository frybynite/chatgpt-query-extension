**Key Privacy Questions:**

- Justify `<all_urls>` permission (paste from `PERMISSIONS_JUSTIFICATION.md`)
- Explain all permissions clearly

## Phase 4: Permissions Justification

When asked about `<all_urls>` permission, use this response:

```
The extension uses a content script with <all_urls> permission exclusively for
keyboard shortcuts functionality.

The lightweight keyboard listener must be available on all websites to allow
users to trigger custom ChatGPT prompts via keyboard shortcuts from any webpage
(job boards, documentation, emails, social media, etc.).

The content script:
- Only listens for configured keyboard shortcuts
- Does not read page content or collect any data
- Only sends a message to the background script when a shortcut is pressed
- Is minimal (~100 lines) and fully auditable in our open source repository

Full justification: https://github.com/keithfry/chatgpt-query-extension/blob/main/PERMISSIONS_JUSTIFICATION.md
```
